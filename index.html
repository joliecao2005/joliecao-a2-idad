        <a href="https://tangerine-bonbon-788ec2.netlify.app/">
          NATURE-THEMED SOUNDBOARD

        <p>⛰️˚₊‧.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>✩ Conceptual Response</h3>
      <p>
        The UI is built responding to the creative prompt of ‘No text
        characters’ which encourages the use of icons. The use of colours and
        accompanying illustrations will be enhanced to highlight the
        functionalities while ensuring clear and cohesive visual feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project explores the blend of sound effects and background music,
        where the users can interact with a simple soundboard. The chosen prompt
        embraces the creation that brings in the breath of nature. The icons are
        aimed to clearly represent the sound effects they can mix in throughout
        the experience. The JavaScript method Math.random() is used to add
        dynamism and serves as an unpredictable element to the soundboard. It is
        a more engaging and playful way to play background music and fosters
        indulging in enjoyment instead of intentionally choosing one. Also,
        Math.random() is used to add a secret sound effect in the midst of
        nature ambience, evoking curiosity and imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designing the soundboard with No text characters prompt enhances the
        accessibility of the interface as users can play around with sounds
        through intuitive imagery. It also strongly supports and communicates
        the nature ambience as the main concept, making it associated and
        approachable. By using visual imagery and randomness, the soundboard
        creates an unexpected audiovisual experience that invites exploration
        and immersion.

      <p>
        These UIs helped shape my understanding of the interactive audio-based
        UIs. All three of them taught me how to emphasise the harmony in
        blending multiple audio clips to create a serene ambience and a
        rewarding audio experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially with Incredibox, I learnt how intriguing and amazing it can
        be to interact with lots of audio inputs at the same time. The drag and
        drop works really impressively, with unpredictable sounds to create
        unique soundscapes. Similarly, myNoise allows users to create auditory
        environments based on their choices and preferences for moods, music,
        and sound effects. It inspired me to consolidate the nature-grounded
        theme and let the users control their customisable natural soundscapes.
        My initial idea was drawn upon Spirit City: Lo-Fi Sessions, to create
        the UI to mix in sounds for study sessions in a game style (something
        calm and relaxing), so my orientation is still the peaceful ambience,
        but in a playful way. After iteration, I wanted to create something
        simpler and minimalist compared to that with illustrations as the key
        visuals, so the soundboard was my choice. The audio controller from
        myNoise would be a significant feature I can consider implementing to
        add depth to my immersive audio environment.
      </p>
      <h3>✩ Technical Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Using the Tone.js library, the soundboard can manage and manipulate the
        sound effects with music tracks for an interactive audiovisual
        experience. Primarily, Tone.js is used to handle soundtrack playback on
        loop with a reverb effect. This audio-based website is built on the
        nature theme, where users can click the visible objects to create a
        certain ambience. With the ‘No text characters’ prompt, to let the icons
        accompany the associated sounds, the sound files are loaded into
        Tone.player objects. Before that, I also edited the initial volume level
        of the sourced sound effects in Reaper. I created an effect by
        Tone.Reverb and then connected audio players to destination and reverb.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>HTML is for the structure of the soundboard elements.</li>
        <li>
          is for elements and layout styling, and visual feedback during
          interaction. I wanted to create the ‘shrunk’ effect for the
          icons/boxes for visual feedback to let the users know which sound is
          chosen/playing, and they can click on it again to return to the
          initial size and stop the audio. While hovering, the icons/boxes are
          also slightly enlarged to indicate that they are clickable.
        </li>
        <li>
          helps handle actions, utilising Tone.js for audio control and
          Math.random() as one of the advanced techniques to return a random
          soundtrack from the audio inputs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When users click on the background music zone, Math.random() selects
        between input tracks to play a random song. The random sound box also
        integrated this method to play one of the secret sound effects. This
        method brings diversity and amazement to the project. When users click
        on the sound effects zone (each box with the attached ‘click’ event),
        the playback function is executed.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
        In addition, I’ve changed from utilising Date.now() to Math.random().
        The initial idea was to alternate daytime and nighttime tracks,
        encouraging multiple visits. However, during iteration, I realised
        adding randomness can effectively add the richness of sounds and enhance
        user engagement within a one-time experience, especially for this
        user-friendly nature soundboard.

      <h3>✩ Reflection on Prototype Feedback</h3>
      <h4>
        01. Was the feedback and mapping clear enough? How did it teach you how
        to use it?
      </h4>
      <p class="title">Quick Summary:</p>
      <img class="feedback" src="feedback-1.jpg" alt="Feedback 1" />
      <p>
        It was nice to see everyone agreeing that the feedback was clear and the
        website was easy and simple to use. Because I created it so I could
        understand it anyway, but I was doubtful if it would be any confusing to
        the users in the way it only had images and they needed to figure out
        how to interact with it. The positive things were the images as buttons
        worked well, as I attempted and expected - how the illustrations
        conveyed and the visual feedback when hovering and clicking on.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was one opinion wondering the meaning of the ‘?’ picture, then
        they realised it was a random button. What I’m considering to make it
        more understandable is illustrating the question mark with the music
        notes to indicate the randomness in sound effects.
      </p>
      <h4>
        02. How different was the end of your experience compared to your first
        impression/ expectation/ understanding of first seeing the interface?
      </h4>
      <p class="title">Quick Summary:</p>
      <img class="feedback" src="feedback-2.jpg" alt="Feedback 2" />
      <p>
        As for the understanding and feeling of the experience, there were three
        key points I could delve deeper into:
      </p>
      <p>
        #1 They acknowledged calmness as a characterisation of the website,
        regarding the aesthetics and audio.
      </p>
      <p class="response">
        → As I’m creating a nature-themed soundboard, it was fulfilling to see
        the users feel the calmness in the aesthetics. However, they were the
        illustrations I sourced from the internet for testing purposes only. I
        didn’t really think about the visual cohesion and intention. So, it’s
        essential for me to keep up the calmness in my official drawings now.
        Moreover, one said it was a misunderstanding with the feet picture as it
        looked like an upbeat track, but not about the footstep sound. So, in my
        illustration, I consider adding some grass around the walking feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        #2 Their expectation was shifted in overall feelings, but not about the
        difference in understanding.
      </p>
      <p class="response">
        → This is good. Because to me, it means the interaction could bring
        something to them through the audiovisual experience, yet it was easy
        and cohesive to interact with.
      </p>
      <p>
        #3 The viewpoints in mixing sounds: all worked together VS. one played
        at a time.
      </p>
      <p class="response">
        → Some considered the fact that all the sound effects could play
        simultaneously with the music a good experience. Some considered it too
        chaotic. While one expected one sound would automatically stop when
        another one is selected, I think it would interrupt the experience.
        Because it’s an intention to mix your own ambience, and I want to
        associate it with the kind of mixed sounds in nature, which paves the
        way for me to consider adding echo. Similarly, one expected shorter
        sounds while I let them play on loop. Shorter sounds wouldn’t build a
        comprehensive experience. On the other hand, because the users are able
        to click to play and pause the sounds, it doesn’t make sense if it
        suddenly stops. Maybe I could consider adding echo, which brings more
        depth and avoids chaos. The soundboard is also created for mixing sounds
        into the desired ambience.
      </p>
      <h4>
        03. How did you feel with the overall interaction and design - was it
        too simple? Should I add more sound boxes?
      </h4>
      <p class="title">Quick Summary:</p>
      <img class="feedback" src="feedback-3.jpg" alt="Feedback 3" />
      <p>
        I thought the UI was too simple and not enough, but they all considered
        the overall interaction and design good, and they liked the minimalism.
        After all, I also recognised that maybe the simplicity would work well
        and balance the higher energy that the audio brings in. To improve, I
        could put more effort into designing the illustrations to communicate
        the vibe well and also consider the nature-themed colour scheme to not
        make the background feel like missing something as feedback. Deeper or
        more visual effects for the boxes upon the click event will be taken
        into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        8 people thought that I didn’t need to add more sound boxes, as it would
        be overwhelming. I agree because playing all the sounds at once now
        seems enough. However, it’s not necessary to do that. The users still
        have their choice to play only whatever they want.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were 6 people who strongly encouraged me to add more sounds
        because it could be more enjoyable and offer more opportunities to
        create more unique sounds. It seems convincing to me, and I think 2-3
        more sounds wouldn’t overcomplicate the experience. On the other hand,
        the users have a diverse selection to choose from in terms of immersing
        themselves in nature.
      </p>
      <p class="response">
        → This is a very significant aspect that is worth thoughtful
        consideration. To have these 9 sound boxes, I’d spent a considerable
        amount of time selecting suitable sound effects and layering them
        together in Reaper to experiment before I decided to use them in the
        final sound boxes. I tried to ensure they were in harmony. So,
        similarly, I will do the same for the next few sounds to try out if I
        could add any more associated natural sounds. If I can’t find and mix
        them well, I will go for the 9 boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Significantly, whether they suggested I add more sounds or not, they all
        recommended that I add the volume control. It’s very helpful to let me
        pay attention to this aspect, allowing the users to adjust their
        preferred sounds.
      </p>
      <p class="response">
        → Maybe I could consider adding distortion, echo, or reverb to certain
        sounds depending on the association of those in nature. For example,
        birds chirping in the distance. In this way, it would create a deeper
        and more realistic audio experience and not make everything solely jump
        in and go off. Going on with the consideration for mixing multiple
        sounds at once or not, it’s a good idea to let the users control the
        volume. In this way, all the sounds can still be playing at once, yet
        controllable and not too chaotic.
