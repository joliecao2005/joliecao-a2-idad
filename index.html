          Nature-Themed Soundboard
        </a>

      <h3>Conceptual Response</h3>
      <p>
        The UI is built responding to the creative prompt of ‘No text
        characters’ which encourages the use of icons. The use of colours and
        accompanying illustrations will be enhanced to highlight the
        functionalities while ensuring the clear and cohesive visual feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project explores the blend of sound effects and background music,
        where the users can interact with a simple soundboard. The chosen prompt
        embraces the creation that brings in the breath of nature. The icons are
        aimed to clearly represent the sound effects they can mix in throughout
        the experience. The Javascript method Math.random() is used to add
        dynamism and serves as an unpredictable element to the soundboard. It is
        a more engaging and playful way to play background music and fosters
        indulging in enjoyment instead of intentionally choosing one. Also,
        Math.random() is used to add a secret sound effect in the midst of
        nature ambience, evoking curiosity and imagination.
      </p>
        Designing the soundboard with No text characters prompt enhances the
        accessibility of the interface as users can play around with sounds
        through intuitive imagery. It also strongly supports and communicates
        the nature ambience as the main concept, making it associated and
        approachable. By using visual imagery and randomness, the soundboard
        creates an unexpected audiovisual experience that invites exploration
        and immersion.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is for the structure of the soundboard elements. CSS is for
        elements and layout styling and visual feedback during interaction. I
        wanted to create the ‘shrunk’ effect for the icons/boxes for visual
        feedback to let the users know which sound is chosen/playing and they
        can click on it again to return the initial size and stop the audio.
        While hovering, the icons/boxes are also slightly enlarged to indicate
        that they are clickable. JavaScript helps handle actions, utilising
        Tone.js for audio control and Math.random() as one of the advanced
        techniques to return a random soundtrack from the audio inputs.
      </p>
      <h3>Visual Plan</h3>
      <h3>Design References</h3>
      <h3>Technical Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Using Tone.js library, the soundboard can manage and manipulate the
        sound effects with music tracks for an interactive audiovisual
        experience. Primarily, Tone.js is used to handle soundtrack playback on
        loop with reverb effect. This audio-based website is built on the nature
        theme where the users can click the visible objects to create a certain
        ambience. With ‘No text characters’ prompt, to let the icons accompany
        the associated sounds, the sound files are loaded into Tone.player
        objects. Before that, I also edited the initial volume level of the
        sourced sound effects in Reaper. I created an effect by Tone.Reverb and
        then connected audio players to destination and reverb.
